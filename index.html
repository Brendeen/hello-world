       <p class="argument">Ahh, the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, one of the coolest net-gen consoles around! Everyone's got one, so why dont <em>you??</em>
        any person with a switch will agree that one of the best features of it is the portablility. There are hundreds and hundreds of big and clunky
        PC parts to take up space in a tower, some PC's even weighing over 60 pounds just by themselves. But the great feature with a switch is taking
        the console off the stand and playing in handheld mode. As long as you have a way to charge your switch, you can take it anywhere! To the park,
        on a plane, on the subway, wherever you want (as long as its not water). Another great feature are the controllers, or "Joy Con's". These
        These little guys can be taken on and off of the switch and can be used either by themselves seperetly or put together in a Joy Con grip to play
        with a controller style. Switch's are much cheaper than getting a new gen console or PC as well,
        with the cheapest option getting a Switch Lite. Speaking of options the switch comes in 3 flavors, The Switch Lite is a very affordable option
        that focuses strictly on the handheld side of the console. No dock or controller grip is included and is recommended for someone who wont hook
        it up to a TV. The Lite costs 200 dollars. The second and most common option is the Switch. As I said before, this option includes a doc and controller grip so you can play
        on the TV! This switch will set you back 300 dollars but is the most versitile. The third option is the newest and best option if you are interested
        in getting one, the Switch Oled costs 350 dollars, but has a bigger Oled screen and extra storage for more games. I highly recommend anyone looking for
        a switch to pick this up because of how crisp the handheld screen looks. The colors pop so much more and makes the experience much more worth it. The
        Oled also comes with a bigger reinforced stand to prop it up. Nintendo offers tons of first party games that can only be played on the switch as well!
        Some of these games include <strong>Mario Odyssey</strong>, <strong>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</strong>, and <strong>Splatoon 3</strong>
        . Nintendo also has freguent deals on its Eshop with tons of first and thrid party games discounted up to 70 percent off! The Nintendo Switch is the 
        perfect console for anyone looking for a great gaming system to take on the go, as well as a great library of games to play in handheld or tv mode!
